#  **Step-by-Step Validation**:
   - After each change (addition, edit, or deletion):
     - Launch the application and verify it works correctly in Telegram WebApp.
     - Check the console for errors.
     - Ensure key features (color selection, maze generation, snail movement, winnings calculation, Solana transactions) work without issues.
   - If something breaks after a change, immediately revert the change and try a different approach.
