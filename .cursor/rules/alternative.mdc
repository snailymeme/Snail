# **Alternative Solutions**:
   - For each issue, propose at least two solutions:
     - First solution: A minimal change that resolves the issue with minimal risk of breaking anything.
     - Second solution: A more significant change (e.g., refactoring) if it improves the code in the long term.
   - Explain the pros and cons of each solution and let me choose before making changes.
