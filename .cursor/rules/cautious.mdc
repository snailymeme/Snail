# **Cautious Deletion**:
   - Never delete code unless you are 100% certain it’s unnecessary. Before deleting:
     - Check if the code is used elsewhere in the project (e.g., by searching the project).
     - Consider whether the issue can be resolved without deletion, such as by adding conditions or refactoring.
     - If deletion is necessary, first preserve the deleted code in comments with an explanation of why it’s being removed, and ask me to review the change.
