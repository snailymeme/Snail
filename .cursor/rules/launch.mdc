# **Launch Verification**:
   - The goal is to ensure the application launches correctly, meaning:
     - The Telegram bot responds to commands (e.g., `/start`).
     - Telegram WebApp opens and displays the interface.
     - The player can select a snail color, place a bet, start a race, and receive winnings.
     - Solana integration via Phantom works: the wallet connects, and transactions are processed.
   - If any of these donâ€™t work, identify the cause, fix it, and retest the launch.
